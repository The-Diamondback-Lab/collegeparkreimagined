          The Hotel at the University of Maryland (OPENED sept. 2017)
        </p>
        <p className="descrip">
          The $180 million project, which opened in September 2017, functions as
          a mixed-used building. The city’s only four-star hotel, it offers
          conference facilities, a bar and “high end” restaurants, such as Old
          Maryland Grill and Kapnos Taverna, on the ground floor. The Hotel
          created more than 400 permanent jobs, which Ulman said would help
          increase the city’s tax base.
          <br /> <br />
          Company offices housed in the Diamondback Garage behind The Hotel will
          include Capital One, Immuta, BlueVoyant and a shared space with the Do
          Good accelerator — which provides leadership coaching and mentoring
          opportunities to students developing nonprofits and other
          philanthropic projects — and will be completed in July creating even
          more jobs, Ulman said.
          <br /> <br />
          Its opening also added 850 garage parking spots to the city.

        <p className="p-heading">Vigilante Coffee (OPENED March 2018)</p>
        <p className="descrip">
          Vigilante Coffee opened in March 2018, replacing #1 Liquors. Ulman
          described the old space as “dumpy looking,” and said this new addition
          makes the area more vibrant for students, residents and visitors.
          <br /> <br />
          “When I ask people what a great college town has, the first or second
          thing out of their mouth is good coffee shops,” Ulman said.
          <br /> <br />
          The cafe’s signature items include specialty coffees, seasonal acai
          bowls and fresh pastries. It provides free WiFi to customers several
          days of the week.

        <p className="p-heading">MilkBoy ArtHouse (OPENED May 2017)</p>
        <p className="descrip">
          Former College Park Mayor Andy Fellows described MilkBoy ArtHouse as a
          “physical manifestation of the new.” The joint restaurant and
          performing arts venue opened in May 2017.
          <br /> <br />
          Olson said a grant award helped fund the “facade improvements,” and
          the partnership worked with the university’s Clarice Smith Performing
          Arts Center to obtain a tax credit for MilkBoy programming.
        </p>

        <p className="p-heading">
          Homeownership Program through the Maryland Department of Housing and
          Community Development’s Community Legacy Grant (began 2015)
        </p>
        <p className="descrip">
          The program awards $15,000 in deferred-payment, forgivable loans for
          university or city employees to use on their down payments and closing
          costs . The loan requires recipients to live within the city limits of
          College Park for ten years, or otherwise repay the loan.
          <br /> <br />
          Olson said that so far, the program has attracted 36 new home buyers.
          He also said the program enables staffers to spend more time in the
          community, reducing their commutes and strengthening the
          neighborhoods.
          <br /> <br />
          “If they are going to help us with a down payment, might as well take
          it,” said homebuyer Laura McGrath Hood, an employee of this
          university.
          <br /> <br />
          However, some potential residents have decided against buying homes
          due to other factors such as schooling.
          <br /> <br />
          Loh said about four percent of faculty and staff lived in College Park
          when he arrived at this university.

          Midtown Revitalization study (THROUGHOUT spring/summer of 2017)
        </p>
        <p className="descrip">
          A redevelopment study was completed last year to help inform
          developers of the “possibilities for redevelopment” in the Midtown
          area, Olson said.
          <br /> <br />
          The study found that there is a high concentration of fast dining and
          convenience stores. Development should focus on “specialty retail
          products and creating an authentic sense of place,” according to the
          report.
          <br /> <br />
          <span>Major student housing/mixed use projects</span>
          <br /> <br />
          Olson said the partnership worked with investors and gave them
          confidence to build the University View The Enclave, Terrapin Rowand
          other student housing complexes.
          <br /> <br />
          The Enclave will begin filling its empty retail space in the coming
          months with a new sushi restaurant named LaTAO . Ryan Chelton, College
          Park’s economic development coordinator, said in February that he
          hopes the opening of LaTAO will cause a “chain reaction” and “draw in
          more retail.”
          <br /> <br />
          A recent housing market survey by this university’s Department of
          Resident Life showed despite all the new apartment buildings springing
          up in the city, most underclassmen at this university still live on
          the campus.
          <br /> <br />
          “Something continually advocated for by students is more affordable
          housing options,” said AJ Pruitt, this university’s Student Government
          Association president for 2017-18. “That’s something that has been
          somewhat left behind.”
          <br /> <br />
          <span>Opening of mixed-use housing project for professionals</span>
          <br /> <br />
          Olson said Domain, which opened in June 2013, was primarily built to
          serve young professionals. When constructed, the Domain was the first
          non-student apartment complex built in the city since 2007. In its
          first year open, The Diamondback reported that most Domain residents
          were professionals who didn’t have any connection to the university.
          <br /> <br />
          Rent for the Domain starts at $1,686/month for a one-bedroom,
          one-bathroom unit, according to its website.
          <br /> <br />
          But some College Park residents said they have never considered the
          Domain as a legitimate option.
          <br /> <br />
          “I was just floored when I saw what it was going to cost. For a family
          with a couple young kids, there was no way in the world that was
          something we could consider,” said resident Jennifer Haislip.
          <br /> <br />
          Leaders of the partnership have also expressed a desire to provide
          more graduate student housing in the coming years.
