          Several major transportation projects will break ground in College
          Park in the coming months, including the long-anticipated Purple Line
          and redevelopment of Route 1. Other smaller projects have been
          completed or have already begun, including the addition of more than
          80 street lights across College Park and the implementation of a pilot
          bike-share program throughout the city and the University of
          Maryland’s campus.

          University and local officials say these changes will be
          “transformative” in making the city safer and more accessible in
          connecting College Park to the greater Washington, D.C. Metro area —
          even after this university’s Department of Transportation Services
          announced it would reduce service for the #104 College Park Metro
          shuttle and other routes.
          <br />
          <br />
          But some aren’t on board with the addition of the Purple Line. Ajay
          Bhatt, president of Friends of Capital Crescent Trail — a nonprofit
          seeking to protect green spaces in Montgomery County — has been
          fighting against the Purple Line for more than a decade. He argued
          light rail technology is outdated and implementing “transit for the
          sake of transit” harms the environment. Only a small, vocal group of
          minority developers stand to benefit from the project, he said. “How
          many scholarships would that pay for?” Bhatt said of the project,
          which is projected to cost $5.6 billion over 36 years. “Does the
          University of Maryland want five years of disruption for a train track
          going through their campus?”
          <br />
          <br />
          University President Wallace Loh, however, said the Purple Line is
          essential to the region’s economic and social development.
          <br />
          <br />
          “If people ask me, ‘What about the incredible inconvenience, the noise
          and the dust and so forth from construction?’ … I say, ‘That’s the
          price to pay for progress,’” Loh said. “Progress for the next 30 years
          or more.”

            Lighting improvements installed in pedestrian areas underway
            <ul>
              <li>
                More than 80 new street lights were added or replaced across the
                city in 2015 as part of an effort to improve safety and brighten
                areas at night, said Eric Olson, executive director of the
                College Park City-University Partnership.
                <li>
                  There have been more projects since then, such as new lights
                  being added to the Route 1 bridge over the Paint Branch Trail.
                  The artistic lighting was installed by Imaginex, an
                  entertainment lighting company founded by university alumnus
                  Eric Mintzer. The lights will be turned on when the power
                  source is installed in the coming months, he said. The color
                  of the lights will change every day and can be scheduled
                  throughout the year to align with holidays and other special
                  events, Mintzer said, adding that the lights will make the
                  bridge a more “vibrant and cooler area” that is “attractive
                  and a cooler place to hang out.”

                <li>
                  The panels were removed in January 2017 to allow bicyclists
                  and drivers more visibility at the intersection of Campus
                  Drive and the Trolley Trail. The changes came after a
                  77-year-old bicyclist was struck and killed on the Trolley
                  Trail in September 2016.

            Purple Line broke ground
            <ul>
              <li>
                The 16-mile, $5.6 billion Purple Line — which will feature five
                stops on or around this university’s campus — had its
                groundbreaking last summer. Construction for the light rail on
                this campus is slated to begin in the coming months, and it
                should take about two to three years to complete, according to
                Carlo Colella, the university’s administration and finance vice
                president. Service is expected to begin in 2022.
              </li>
              <li>
                Loh called the Purple Line project “transformational” because of
                its potential influence on the economy, infrastructure and
                “social cohesion” of the surrounding area. He said The Hotel at
                the University of Maryland “would never have been built” if it
                weren’t for the plans to bring in the Purple Line.
              </li>
              <li>
                Olson added that the Purple Line could lead to job growth.
                Montgomery County — where the Purple Line will have 10 stops —
                is one of 20 sites nationwide that were shortlisted for Amazon’s
                proposed second headquarters, HQ2. Amazon expects the project to
                bring as many as 50,000 jobs, and Loh said the Purple Line would
                help College Park reap those benefits.
              </li>
              <li>
                “They’re expected to bring in 50,000 employees. Not all of them
                are going to be living in White Flint, Montgomery County,” he
                said. “Many of them will want to live in the College Park area,
                in Prince George’s County because the rents are cheaper, plus
                they’re next to a major university.”

                Purple Line construction will reduce parking spots on the
                campus, Department of Transportation Services Executive Director
                David Allen told The Diamondback in March.

              <li>
                Colella said the university community “needs to be patient with
                the construction activities” and referred to it as a temporary
                inconvenience — similar to the construction of the Edward St.
                John Learning and Teaching Center.

                As city and university officials seek to make the region more
                hospitable for pedestrians and bikes alike, students and city
                residents are able to use bike-share options in lieu of cars or
                public transportation.
              </li>
              <li>
                The mBike program, a three-year pilot program started in May
                2016, is a partnership between this university, the city of
                College Park and bike-share company Zagster. It provides bikes
                at 23 stations in the College Park area and on the campus. More
                than 3,700 riders have taken more than 62,000 trips in the two
                years since the program launched, according to mBike data.
              </li>
              <li>
                With a year left, university and city officials will begin
                negotiating to either extend the contract with Zagster or go in
                another direction.
              </li>
              <li>
                DOTS spokesperson Anna McLaughlin said the department was “very

                possible.

              <li>
                “We have no reason not to, unless [Zagster] can’t provide

                According to city officials, construction on the first phase of
                the state-funded Route 1 redevelopment will begin this year.
                Improvements will include bike lanes, wider sidewalks, medians
                and designated turn lanes between College Avenue and University
                Boulevard.

                “It should be a safer place for cyclists, bicyclists and

                This university’s Department of Transportation Services recently
                announced the elimination or reduction of service on several
                shuttle bus routes, which will go into effect July 1. According
                to Allen, the cuts were intended to address a budget deficit of
                at least $700,000. As per the CPCUP website, the partnership
                will “work to increase the availability, frequency and
                efficiency of bus transit in the city.”

                in the fall 2018 semester due to Purple Line construction. The
                campus has seen scores of parking spaces disappear over the past
                several years due to other construction projects. About 200
                spots near the Jeong H. Kim Engineering building were removed in
                2015 renovations, and another 400 went away due to construction
                of the Brendan Iribe Center.
