          “When I came here in 2010, I knew nothing about K-12 education,
          nothing about revitalizing an area -- zip, zero,” said President Loh.
          But soon after, he learned that the two went hand-in-hand.
        </h3>
        <p>
          After his first meeting with U3 Advisors LLC CEO Omar Blaik, Loh
          realized that the university would attract more families and
          professionals to the area if it worked to make the local schools more
          competitive relative to the rest of the state. As a first step,
          similar to the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Alexander Charter
          School, the University of Maryland created its own blended learning
          middle and high school designed to prepare students for college. The
          school enrolls students based on a highly competitive lottery system.
          <br />
          <br />
          Executive Director Bernadette Ortiz-Brewster said many variables have
          contributed to the school’s growth and success since it opened in
          2013.
          <br />
          <br />
          “One of the most exciting parts is that [University of Maryland]
          students come in and propose their own courses and programs,” she
          said. In that way, “it’s a different curriculum than what else is
          being offered.”
          <br />
          <br />
          But critics have voiced the need for additional competitive schooling
          options, noting that the lack of programs like College Park Academy
          drive them away from College Park.
          <br />
          <br />
          “As somebody with a one year old, it is difficult to find, when you
          compare yourself to other, large state schools.” said resident Mark
          Fuge. “I can usually convince [potential homebuyers] of all the other
          things, but it always comes back down to, yeah but the public schools
          in Montgomery County or Howard County are better.”

                  the academy has produced some of the top test scores in the
                  state of Maryland
                </b>, outperforming not just the county and state but also
                Howard and Montgomery County Schools in some areas. Next year
                the academy will graduate its first senior class.
              </li>
              <li>
                Loh attributes the school’s success to “the huge numbers of
                University of Maryland students who go and tutor and mentor
                them.” He also schools from all over Prince George’s County have
                expressed interest in replicating portions of the CPA model in
                their schools.
              </li>
              <li>
                “And that’s one of the things we’re exploring,” Loh said, “in
                fact, we’re having a conversation with an organization to take
                College Park Academy to other parts of the state.”

                With the addition of a new local boundary area for College Park
                Academy, students living in the jurisdictions of six area
                elementary schools will comprise at least 35 percent of the
                students admitted: Berwyn Heights, Cherokee Lane, Hollywood,
                Paint Branch, Riverdale and University Park. Olson said this
                should provide assurance to local families applying to College
                Park Academy.
              </li>
              <li>
                Next year, the school will enroll up to 675 students, said
                Executive Director Bernadette Ortiz-Brewster. She said some
                1,675 children are on the waitlist.
              </li>
              <li>
                Olson said the the “new sibling preference” usually works to
                enroll siblings of current students to help parents feel more
                assured with the lottery system.
              </li>

                Olson said two new programs for young children are expected to
                launch in 2019. He said the university currently has just one
                daycare center for staffers, which has waiting list.

                The daycare center will be placed a few blocks from City Hall in

                According to Olson, the survey examined what local parents want
                out of Prince George’s County Public Schools. He said the
                results will be used to help inform lawmakers and policymakers.

                Loh said a systemic transformation of the local school system
                will “take years and years” to accomplish but additions like
                College Park Academy “is a reason why we’re seeing an uptick in

                Leaders will also “catalog, package and promote local College

                Olson said while there are no formal plans for this venture or

                logistics soon. He said these programs will hopefully involve
                “learning in a fun way” and allow students with space and
                assistance to do homework, as well as offer other “creative
                things” such as art, drama and music.
