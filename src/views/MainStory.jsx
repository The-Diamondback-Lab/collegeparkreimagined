          Drafted in 2011, the University District Vision 2020 aims to shape
          College Park into a top 20 college town by 2020.Two years before that
          deadline, how close are they?

          As a longtime resident of Hyattsville, Jocelyn Nolasco grew up
          criticizing the lack of cohesion between her city and the nearby
          University of Maryland.
          <br /> <br />
          “You don’t have to go five minutes down the road to see what’s been
          forgotten,” the junior government and politics major said. “People
          barely remember that there’s a high school down the street.”
          <br /> <br />
          But Nolasco, a Parkdale High School graduate, has noticed a marked
          difference in the relationship between the state’s flagship university
          and the surrounding municipalities -- and it gives her hope. She said
          the commitment to bettering local schools and building direct
          school-to-college pipelines via College Park Academy has made the
          university seem like less of a “bubble.”
          <br /> <br />
          “I care about the development,” she said. “This is a resource people
          need.”
          <br /> <br />
          The College Park City University Partnership is a non-profit
          corporation working toward this end by pooling resources from
          government, the private sector, and the university. The group plans,
          executes and offers support to initiatives aimed at enhancing College
          Park’s liveability during all 12 months of the year, including during
          the university’s summer and winter breaks. Focusing on the holistic
          redevelopment of the area, a critical area of the strategy centers on
          attracting more university faculty members to live in College Park
          with their families.
          <br /> <br />
          Commonly cited achievements accomplished within the last eight years
          include effectively lobbying the state to commit to full funding of
          the Purple Line Metro that will run through the University of Maryland
          campus and connect New Carrollton and Bethesda; the creation of
          College Park Academy, a rigorous college-prep charter school that
          offers a blended-learning education and allows students to
          concurrently enroll in up to 25 credits of University of Maryland
          coursework; the establishment of a homeownership program that provides
          zero-interest, deferred payment, forgivable loans to University of
          Maryland employees who live within the city’s boundaries; the opening
          of Milkboy Arthouse, a joint restaurant and live music venue; the
          expansion of the UMPD jurisdiction to encompass more ground; the
          attainment of College Park’s Maryland Sustainable Community
          certification; and the implementation of new bike-sharing stations and
          pedestrian-friendly walkways.
          <br /> <br />
          Five inmainidual committees, specializing in housing and
          redevelopment, transportation, public safety, education and
          sustainability help create and guide annual work plans to submit to
          the partnership’s board of directors for approval. The committees
          physically bring together local College Park stakeholders -- including
          elected officials, university administrators and state delegates --
          who otherwise might not congregate voluntarily. Each committee
          contains at least one committee chair (such as the mayor, a state
          delegate, or a former mayor), one partnership board member (often an
          experienced lawmaker or consultant), two city council members, two
          university administrators, at least one county council member, and one
          state legislator.
          <br /> <br />
          The committees do not implement changes; they lack inmainidual budgets
          and the authority to distribute funds, levy taxes or allocate
          resources as desired. Rather, committees join forces to help advise,
          execute and oversee different projects proposed by the partnership,
          often serving a retroactive rather than proactive purpose.
          <br /> <br />
          “The biggest thing is that it’s a collaboration, and we are working
          together, productively, and with a concrete vision to achieve these
          goals of making College Park an even greater college town,” said Eric
          Olson, the executive director of CPCUP. “That’s how things get done,
          when we work collaboratively.”
          <br /> <br />
          Much of the original work plan stems from a blueprint designed by U3
          Advisors LLC, a consulting firm that provides inmainidualized
          redevelopment strategies to communities. Omar Blaik, the CEO and
          co-founder of the practice, said he examined other university towns
          such as Ann Arbor and Philadelphia and compared them to College Park.
          <br /> <br />
          “In the original studies, we found quite a bit of differences between
          [top college towns] and College Park. Here, there was a lack of
          mainersity in housing types, limited employment options, less density,
          less retail and amenities, less businesses that congregate around the
          campus,” Blaik said. “The university had grown in size and in caliber
          over time, but the city never caught up.”
          <br /> <br />
          Leaders of the partnership attribute much of the area’s rapid growth
          and revitalization in the years since to the appointment of University
          of Maryland President Wallace D. Loh, who assumed the role in 2010.
          <br /> <br />
          Sen. James C. Rosapepe (D-College Park), chair of the partnership’s
          board of directors, said Loh’s support of the partnership and of
          Vision 2020 has led to “unprecedented” momentum. He also said his
          constituents have supported “moving in this direction” for decades,
          but growth stunted under Loh’s predecessors.
          <br /> <br />
          “The challenge was that, before, the university was focused on the
          university,” Rosapepe said.
          <br /> <br />
          Now, under President Loh, who Rosapepe said “has been a real hero on
          this,” the area has “made real progress,” especially in terms of
          solidifying the relationship between the two entities.
          <br /> <br />
          “I’m happy to tell you the reason why [progress has been made] is that
          the relationships were almost nonexistent before I came here,” Loh
          said.“What I learned is... you always make decisions not only to solve
          the problem right now, but you think about its implication 20 to 30
          years down the line,”
          <br /> <br />
          However, critics of the partnership charge that the lack of student
          and permanent resident presence on the board and the committees has
          excluded those voices from the conversation, often to their detriment.
          The Diamondback’s editorial board has previously asserted in at least
          three separate columns that the city’s “vanity projects” have fueled a
          “rapidly gentrifying landscape,” offering limited respite for a
          financially burdened student or family.
          <br /> <br />
          However, “In a district like College Park, the threat of
          gentrification is much more a perceived threat rather than an actual
          one,” said Blaik, a former senior vice president at the University of
          Pennsylvania who helped lead a similar transformation in Philadelphia.
          “The minority of housing in Old Town are owner occupied. Little
          displacement occurs because there’s a limited renter market for
          long-term residents.”
          <br /> <br />
          But Loh, who acknowledged the “economic consequences” of
          redevelopment, said the university, together with the city and county
          governments, signed a commitment to protecting low income communities
          and inmainiduals from displacement and “getting priced out.”
          <br /> <br />
          And Carlo Colella, the university’s vice president of finance and
          administration, said the leadership actively works to safeguard the
          interests of students and current residents.
          <br /> <br />
          “We’re bringing about amenities that are keeping residents here who
          would otherwise move,” Colella said. “We’re redeveloping vacant
          property, so really, we’re adding to the housing offerings.”
          <br /> <br />
          Under the leadership of Ken Ulman, the university’s chief strategy
          officer for economic development and the founder and CEO of Margrave
          Strategies, the collaboration is also slated to add “a couple hundred
          jobs” to College Park’s Discovery District business and research park
          starting in July. Ulman said the new office space will host “the kind
          of companies that we want to collaborate with faculty and staff and
          want to hire our students as interns and then full-time employees.”
          <br /> <br />
          Parris Glendening, the governor of Maryland at the time of the
          partnership’s creation, said the university “would not have survived”
          had it not embraced redevelopment. Now the president of Smart Growth
          America’s Leadership Institute and the Governor’s Institute on
          Community Design, he said he often fields calls about the city and
          requests for tours from similar groups and elected officials in other
          cities.
          <br /> <br />
          “They’re studying us and trying to figure out how we are doing it,” he
          said. “I think our little university becoming a national model is
          pretty exciting.”
          <br /> <br />
          But meanwhile, some longtime residents have expressed fear that
          College Park’s historic quaintness will evolve into a louder, busier,
          more congested area that does not reflect their lifestyles. And
          several students have voiced concerns over the university’s negligence
          of matters of student life, such as increasing parking options,
          expanding affordable off-campus housing and building more grocery
          stores within walking distance.
          <br /> <br />
          “I don’t see the student voice represented there,” said outgoing SGA
          President AJ Pruitt about the partnership. Although he believes
          College Park “is better off” with the partnership in place, he said
          the focus on recruiting young professionals and university staffers to
          live in the city has come at a cost to other stakeholders.
          <br /> <br />
          “They say they’re helping students by developing, but I don’t think
          that can be true if you don’t fully incorporate students into the
          leadership,” Pruitt said.
          <br /> <br />
          And while the partnership has exceeded the expectations of many
          involved, leaders admit that much of the work lies ahead.
          <br /> <br />
          “We always knew we weren’t creating the 2020 goal as something that
          would be done in 2020,” said former College Park Mayor Andrew Fellows,
          who helped draft the University District Vision 2020 document. “It was
          designed to address the long-standing challenges of the mainide. We’ve
          succeeded in that respect.”
