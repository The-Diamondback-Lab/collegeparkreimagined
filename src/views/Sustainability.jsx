          College Park and the University of Maryland have several sustainable
          initiatives in the works, from adding solar panels to city buildings
          to getting every school associated with the city involved with “green”
          projects.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Most recently, College Park and WMATA have been working out an
          agreement for a community garden that “should be finalized in the
          coming weeks,” according to a city document. And the city’s Department
          of Public Works installed square pizza box receptacles at two
          locations downtown last week, which had been in the works since last
          year. This was to stop the overflowing of the boxes, which do not fit
          in the circle shaped recycle bins across the city. <br />
          <br />“A simple fix over the course of a year is going to save
          hundreds of boxes out of the landfills,” said junior government and
          politics major Jonathan Glaser, who was behind the idea of adding the
          pizza box recycle bins to the city. <br />
          <br />Glaser said both this university and College Park “are doing
          exactly what they should be doing” when it comes to sustainable
          initiatives. Yet previous College Park Mayor Andrew Fellows, who was
          also the past chair of the city’s sustainability committee, said that
          environmental endeavors were not the original priority of the Vision
          2020 plan. <br />
          <br />“As we came up with the vision, we realized we probably weren’t
          going to prioritize stuff equally,” Fellows said. “I somewhat
          consciously said, ‘This isn’t going to be the leading effort.’”

        <ul>
          <li>
            College Park is a certified Maryland Sustainable Community
            <ul>
              <li>
                College Park achieved this certification in 2013 and it is
                renewable up to three years. In 2016, the city became
                recertified.
              </li>
              <li>
                To be granted certification towns must pass a resolution stating
                their intent to become certified. Then, they must register
                online at this university’s Environmental Finance Center’s
                “Sustainable Maryland” website. Next, they select what actions
                they will take part in, create and designate a green team
                governed by the town to be in charge of these efforts and
                finally, submit an application for certification on the website.
              </li>
              <li>
                Each action taken is associated with a number of points earned.
                To become certified, towns need to earn at least 150 points. In
                2013, College Park earned 190 points. In 2016, the city improved
                to 250 points.
              </li>
              <li>
                Possible actions towns can take include creating a local food
                fair, building community gardens, creating a climate action
                plan, implementing a workplace wellness program and developing a
                pet waste education program.
              </li>
              <li>
                Actions College Park specifically took include: establishing
                local farmers markets, building community gardens and hosting
                local food cooking and preservation classes.
              </li>
              <li>
                The city and university are implementing “green” projects to
                increase residential energy efficiency, reduce stormwater
                pollution, plant trees, increase use of local food and much
                more.
              </li>
              <li>
                College Park has reduced municipal electricity consumption by
                more than 20 percent since 2013. It has replaced about 200
                lights in the downtown parking garage with LED lighting, which
                saves 50 percent in electricity consumption.
              </li>
              <li>
                The city also installed solar panels on top of its Youth, Family
                and Senior Services Building and Public Works Repair Garage and
                is on track to meet the goal of producing 20 percent of
                municipal energy needs from on-site renewable energy. It cost
                about $70,000 each to install solar panels on the buildings,
                which were funded by grants from the Maryland Energy
                Administration.
              </li>
              <li>
                The city has sponsored rain barrel workshops since 2013, has
                sold low-cost food compost bins to residents for the past year
                and provides pet waste pickup stations in parks and along
                trails.
              </li>
              <li>
                The city has been a Tree City USA for more than two decades. The
                program recognizes cities that promote healthy tree management.
                This university — as of 2016 more than 26 percent of this campus
                is covered in trees — is part of Tree Campus USA, a similar
                program but strictly for colleges and universities.
              </li>
              <li>
                There are also two city-sponsored farmer’s markets that promote
                local distributors.
              </li>
              <li>
                Several buildings at this university — including Cumberland Hall
                and the Edward St. John Learning and Teaching Center — have
                green roofs, which host plants, reduce stormwater runoff and
                filter out rain-borne pollutants.
              </li>
              <li>
                This university has an initiative called the Partnership for
                Action Learning in Sustainability, which partnered with College
                Park in 2015 to address sustainability challenges. Students in
                specific classes have helped multiple areas and counties in
                Maryland. Past College Park projects included recommendations
                for reducing solid waste and increasing recycling and plans for
                the development of a greenhouse gas inventory.
              </li>
              <li>
                A solar co-op forum was held to explore solar energy options for
                city residents with the City Committee for a Better Environment
              </li>
              <li>
                The last forum was in 2016 and about 20 to 30 people signed up
                for solar energy at the meeting.
              </li>
              <li>
                Solar energy options for city residents: Join a co-op (where a
                group of people share the cost together), purchase solar panels
                yourself, have a power purchase agreement with a contractor
                (where the homeowner signs a lease for the contractor to buy,
                install and maintain the panels), etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                “We’d like to do another one soon, maybe another one later this
                summer or early fall,” said Steve Beavers, the city’s community
                development coordinator.

            Composting: With City of College Park, pursue opportunities to
            strengthen a food composting program for residents. Partnership
            supporting and promoting.
            <ul>
              <li>
                There are quarterly meetings about food waste composting. The
                city also sells composting bins – made of recycled material –
                that residents can purchase for $20 and non-residents for $40.
              </li>
              <li>
                “We are interested in doing [a food composting program],
                exploring different ways to make it possible, whether that would
                be household pickup or a centralized collection area, but we are
                not really ready to present anything yet,” Beavers said.
              </li>
              <li>
                Students have been involved in this process, Beavers said.
                Students from ENSP400: Capstone in Environmental Science and
                Policy who did a project on food composting gave a presentation
                on their fundings to city officials, recommending they continue
                to encourage backyard food scrap composting because it has the
                best cost/benefit proposition.
              </li>
              <li>
                College Park will also have a trial food waste compost available
                at the Hollywood Farmer’s market starting in July, said Valerie
                Woodall, the senior program associate for the College Park
                City-University Partnership.

            Community Gardens: Open the Community Garden in Calvert Hills in
            2018. Continue to work with the City and University on community
            garden opportunities. Partnership supporting.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Currently, the city has two community gardens — one in Old Town
                and one in Hollywood. Each plot in the garden is filled with a
                mix of compost and topsoil and is 4 feet wide and 10 feet long.
                Only residents of College Park can get a membership for a plot,
                which is $15 per year.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Old Town garden has 40 plots, while the Hollywood garden has
                14 plots. It costs the city about $50 to build each plot. The
                money to build these community gardens comes from the city’s
                sustainability fund.
              </li>
              <li>
                “The latest city survey done had community gardens ranked very
                high in resident satisfaction,” Beavers said. “The best part for
                me is that the community gardens bring together a lot of types
                of people who normally wouldn’t react. There are members who are
                students, faculty of the university, retirees, just people from
                all walks of life brought together by their common interest of
                gardening.”
              </li>
              <li>
                There is a plan to build a third community garden in Calvert
                Hills on metro property, which would start out with about a
                dozen plots. However, before that can happen WMATA and College
                Park have to work out an agreement that would allow city
                employees and residents to enter the property.
              </li>
              <li>
                “It’s very close — I’d love to see it start this summer and I
                think we are almost there,” Beavers said. “They’ve been really
                open to idea of having garden there and it’s great to even be
                able to have this conversation with them.”

            Recycling Rates and County “Rain Check” Program: Assist the City and
            County with increasing recycling rates as well as homeowner
            participation in the County “Rain Check” program to install
            environmental site design and rain barrels at homes in the City of
            College Park. Partnership promoting.
            <ul>
              <li>
                As of a few months ago, 22 people in College Park had applied
                for the rain check rebate. It is a financial incentive program,
                which “provides eligible applicants the opportunity to receive a
                reimbursement for installing approved stormwater management
                practices,” according to the Chesapeake Bay Trust website.
              </li>
              <li>
                Funding, which is given through grants by the Chesapeake Bay
                Trust, consists of up to $4,000 for residential property owners
                and up to $20,000 for commercial properties.
              </li>
              <li>
                An event was held to educate residents about rain barrels, and
                in the summer of 2017, 105 rain barrels were sold at the County
                Rain Check rebate program. More than 50 people attended.
              </li>
              <li>
                “There were two events since we sold so many rain barrels, we
                extended the sale and held a second pick up that included a rain
                barrel installation demonstration,” Woodall said in an email.
                There will be a Sustainability Expo on July 14 where people can
                pick up more rain barrels.

            Clean Energy: We will assist with ways to increase the share of
            clean energy use in College Park. We will create numeric goals for
            benchmarking purposes. We will explore strategies to implement so
            that by 2020 there will be 200 solar arrays city-wide and all
            residents, businesses and the University can rely 100% on clean,
            carbon-neutral, energy. Our work may include promoting options for
            clean-energy use and pursuing programs to provide “green” incentives
            to homeowners and businesses. Partnership promoting.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Right now, the city purchases 100 percent renewable energy
                off-site from a regional contractor. On-site, it currently
                produces 10 percent of clean energy using the solar panels
                recently installed. The city is on track to meet the goal of
                producing 20 percent of municipal energy needs from on-site
                renewable energy by 2020.
              </li>
              <li>
                “The challenge is that electricity is being purchased by
                individual account holders, every single household and business
                in College Park,” said Mark Stewart,sustainability manager for
                this university’s Office of Sustainability. “More than 10,000
                are unique Pepco accounts, and whereas each individual can
                choose to receive clean energy, there needs to be a way to
                provide it for all utility customers so every individual won’t
                have to take action.”
              </li>
              <li>
                Stewart, who is also one of the co-chairs for the city’s
                sustainability committee, said a possible solution to increasing
                renewable energy on-site is to create a large-scale renewable
                energy project on or off-site. This would generate electricity
                itself and help to offset non-renewable energy usage in College
                Park. The cost could be around $100,000 a year for the city.

                Currently, this university operates around 10,000 solar panels
                on campus buildings within the city, and the city operates about
                200 solar panels.

                There are many signs across the campus highlighting “green”
                projects. Some examples include: the Community Learning Garden,
                Maryland Educational Solar Array at the A.V. Williams building,
                and in the second floor hallway of the Stamp Student Union
                highlighting the green roofs on top of the Atrium and Prince

              <li>
                In College Park, there are signs for various stormwater
                treatment projects. The signs explain what stormwater treatment
                is and the environmental benefit of it. Each sign costs “a
                couple hundred bucks,” Beavers said.
              </li>
              <li>
                There are no specific plans as of now to add more markers around

                This university has to comply with a new stormwater permit,
                mandating a lot of improvements, Stewart said. One project is a
                restoration to the Campus Creek behind Eppley Recreation Center,
                which will improve the flow of the stream. This project is
                funded from a 2014 grant from the Maryland Department of Natural
                Resources for about $1.5 million along with a $50,000 grant from
                the University Sustainability Fund.The next phase of the project
                involves construction that starts this summer and is supposed to

                The city took part in a few projects last year, including the

                pool and absorb into the ground in that area, along with gutters
                that go into a box that filters into soil. Both projects are
                covered by a grant from the Chesapeake Bay Trust.

                “We’d like to do more all over the city,” Beavers said.
                “Whenever we can find an opportunity to do stormwater treatment,
                we will. … It is really something we want to do because of the
                environmental benefit of it.”

                “There are four high schools, plus all the middle schools and
                elementary schools that feed into those, so there are more like
                30 schools or so,” Fellows said. “We need someone or a group of
                people to help all the school coordinators in getting their work
                done of applying to be a green school and keeping that status.”

                To become a green school, institutions must create a committee,
                have a school-wide celebration, have a minimum of 10 percent of
                teachers attend environmental education professional
                development, create online resources, add environmental issue
                instruction to the curriculum, have student-driven
                sustainability practices, have community partnerships and take
                some additional steps.

                One College Park school that has reached green school status is
                Paint Branch Elementary, which achieved it in 2016. This
                institution recycles 4,000 pounds of materials per year, has two
                outdoor classrooms and on average has eight no-waste lunch days
                per year. There are nine schools serving College Park students
                with this status and three without it.

                The William S. Schmidt Outdoor Education Center partnered with
                the city with the goal of having every school serving College
                Park students be a green school. The center “provides many
                resources and support for schools to become green schools
                including professional development, application support, green
                projects support, and more,” according to a meeting document.
                The city sustainability committee is working on finding a way
                for this university to work with the center to support local
                College Park schools with Green School projects.

                there yet,” Fellows said.
