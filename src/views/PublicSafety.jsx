        <h3 className="first-line">
          In an effort to connect the town and the city, the committee aims for
          College Park to not only be ranked among the safest college towns, but
          also be perceived as such. Leaders say the public safety initiatives
          equally benefit all stakeholders, from students to residents.
          <br />
          <br />
          Loh said that though crime has gone down since his arrival, many do
          not realize that fact due to the frequency of UMD Alerts sent to the
          community.

        <ul>

            Expanded UMD Student Code of Conduct throughout the City
            <ul>
              <li>
                According to Andrea Goodwin, director of the Office of Student
                Conduct and a member of the public safety committee, the number
                of off-campus complaints involving students have approximately
                doubled since 2013 when the code expanded. She said most of the
                off-campus complaints are resolved quickly and generally entail
                noise violations, disorderly conduct or drug and alcohol abuse.
                She said the expansion has clarified the reporting process and
                helps students avoid contact with UMPD or PGCPD.
              </li>
              <li>
                “Instead of students having to potentially stand in criminal
                court, it’s now being handled by the university,” she said.
                “They did that because it’s a blurred line between city and
                campus, and we’d rather work with our students and help them
                learn from their mistakes rather than punishing them.”
              </li>
              <li>
                She said sanctions typically include an educational penalty or a
                discussion about how their behavior affects the community, and
                once the complaint resolves “we usually never see them again.
                For most, it is their first and last violation.”

            Expansion of UMD Police Jurisdiction to more of the City
            <ul>
              <li>
                According to Eric Olson, UMPD’s expansion increased into areas
                where more students live, primarily in the downtown and old town
                areas but also as far up as I-193 and Greenbelt so as to enhance
                police presence in the midtown, Berlin, Lakewood and Calvert
                neighborhoods. Olson said this required hiring more officers.
              </li>
              <li>
                Loh said increasing the police presence was a major priority of
                his from the start. When the city refused to subsidize the new
                hires, Loh decided the university would pay for them if they
                were given broader jurisdiction.
              </li>
              <li>
                “And over the past seven years, crime in College Park has
                steadily going down,” Loh said. “The numbers are there.”

            Public Safety Cameras implementation (55 cameras city-wide)
            <ul>
              <li>
                According to a study conducted by the Police Foundation, College
                Park has installed a total of 54 security cameras (one short of
                what’s alleged on the website) using city funds as well as grant
                money. Olson said they have been installed “over a number of
                years.” Cameras are located in the city parking garages, along
                the trolley trail, in Old Town, Calvert Hills and Lakeland.
              </li>
              <li>
                Olson said he hopes to increase the number of cameras later this
                year using leftover grant money raised in 2017.
              </li>
              <li>
                He also said while UMPD monitors the cameras, not all cameras
                are actively monitored. An assessment conducted by The Police
                Foundation found “that requests for review averaged about 450
                per year with usable video becoming available about half the
                time and an average of approximately 27 arrests per year. No
                data is available to determine how many arrests resulted from
                active monitoring of the cameras.”
              </li>
              <li>
                A commitment to adjusting the camera plan and strategy based on
                the results of the study is included in the 2018 work plan.

            County Nuisance Board implemented
            <ul>
              <li>
                Olson helped pass legislation to enact the board during his time
                on the county council. It was established after he left the
                board in 2014. He said it helps to regulate matters of
                “particularly egregious damages to home properties” such as
                “renting out housing without the permits.”
              </li>
              <li>The board can revoke rental licenses or distribute fines.</li>
              <li>
                Olson said he did not have information on how many complaints
                the board has adjudicated.

            Launched and completed Public Safety Ambassador pilot program
            <ul>
              <li>
                According to Olson, UMPD managed and trained the ambassadors, a
                mix of both students and non-students, who received an hourly
                wage for their nighttime patrol service. The partnership helped
                secure grant money for the program’s first year.
              </li>
              <li>
                The ambassadors served as “eyes and ears” for the community,
                walking around in police jurisdiction areas with two-way radios.
                Olson said they not only patrolled but also provided directions
                and escorts.
              </li>
              <li>
                The program’s funding ran out after the first year. Olson said
                the partnership was not able to provide additional funding, but
                the police could choose to renew the program on its own.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Police Foundation lauded the program in its 2018 assessment.

            Awarded and completed Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design
            analysis of the Trolley Trail
            <ul>
              <li>
                A program provided by the The U.S. Department of Justice
                provides technical assistance to jurisdictions via crime
                prevention through environmental design. With the five-mile
                trolley trail connecting Hyattsville and College Park with a
                clear pedestrian route, Olson said they wanted to have it
                assessed so that once it opened it would be used as much as
                possible.
              </li>
              <li>
                The CPTED study measures overgrowth, visibility and illumination
                among other factors. Recommendations for improvement included
                adding more cameras and lighting, cutting back overgrowth and
                applying general maintenance to certain areas.
              </li>
              <li>
                Olson said each municipality will address lighting with their
                individual budgets. He also said he’s hopeful that they can use
                some grant money to place additional cameras in the trolley
                trail this year.

          Highlights of the Public Safety 2018 Work Plan
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Review City’s Public Safety and Police Services Study:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Long term recommendations include creating a standalone College
                Park Police Department that “would allow for more flexible and
                more responsive staffing allocation decisions” as well as a
                real-time call-monitoring and data collection center.
              </li>
              <li>
                The study supported funding additional live camera monitoring
                services, though it acknowledged this may not prove feasible
                given the current budget.
              </li>
              <li>
                It also encouraged contracting or combining resources with
                another local police agency, though the authors also questioned
                the feasibility of this.
              </li>

            Review and support City camera plan:
            <ul>
              <li>
                As per the assessment: “Determining where the crime hotspots
                are, re-installing cameras in those areas, and increasing the
                number of usable videos that lead to identifying and arresting
                suspects is an attainable goal for College Park. Longer term, as
                innovation continues to expand available options and reduce
                prices, the City should either partner with other local agencies
                or the Prince George’s County Office of Information Technology
                to establish a realtime (sic) crime center where cameras can be
                monitored and viewers can dispatch law enforcement to crimes as
                they are occuring.”
              </li>
            </ul>

            Public Safety Ambassador Pilot Program:
            <ul>
              <li>
                The Police Foundation study urged the city to “explore
                opportunities to keep the Safety Ambassador Program functional
                and funded. If funding cannot be secured, an alternative option
                might be to implement it as a police cadet program for students
                in the Administration of Justice program at the University, or
                to recruit local community members who are interested in
                providing volunteer services.”
